Hey cloud explorers ‚Äî Bit the Chipmunk here! When an exam question asks ‚ÄúWhich load balancer should we use?‚Äù, your job is to map **requirements ‚Üí constraints ‚Üí the right LB**. This article gives you the decision patterns, quick rules, and exam clues to choose *ALB, NLB,* or *GWLB* (and when to combine them).

## üß≠ Quick decision summary (if you‚Äôre in a hurry)

* **ALB (Application Load Balancer)** ‚Äî Use for **HTTP/HTTPS**, host/path routing, WAF, and Layer-7 features (cookies, headers, OIDC).
* **NLB (Network Load Balancer)** ‚Äî Use for **high-performance TCP/UDP**, static IPs, or TLS passthrough.
* **GWLB (Gateway Load Balancer)** ‚Äî Use to **insert inspection appliances** (firewalls/IDS) transparently using GENEVE encapsulation.

## üîé How to pick ‚Äî match requirements to LB capabilities

Below are common exam requirements and the reasoning you should use to choose an LB.

### 1) HTTP(S) apps that need smart routing, WAF, or auth

**Choose:** **ALB**
**Why:** ALB is Layer 7 so it can route by host/path, integrate with AWS WAF, and terminate TLS using ACM certs ‚Äî all examy keywords. Use ALB when you must inspect headers or apply application-level rules.

**Exam clue:** ‚ÄúRoute `/api/*` to service A and `/web/*` to service B‚Äù ‚Üí ALB.

---

### 2) Low-latency, high-concurrency TCP/UDP apps or need static IPs

**Choose:** **NLB**
**Why:** NLB is Layer 4, excellent at millions of connections and very low latency. It preserves client source IP (useful for logging/ACLs) and supports static IPs/Elastic IPs ‚Äî a big plus for firewall rules or hybrid peers. Use NLB for gaming, VoIP, gRPC, or custom protocols.

**Exam clue:** ‚ÄúRequire millions of concurrent TCP connections‚Äù or ‚Äúmust preserve client IP‚Äù ‚Üí NLB.

---

### 3) Centralized packet inspection (IDS/IPS, enterprise TLS inspection)

**Choose:** **GWLB** + inspection appliances
**Why:** GWLB forwards traffic (GENEVE encapsulation) to appliance fleets without terminating sessions; perfect for transparent inline inspection and enterprise security controls. Use GWLB when you must inspect all ingress/egress traffic centrally.

**Exam clue:** ‚ÄúAll traffic must be passed through a firewall farm or IDS for inspection‚Äù ‚Üí GWLB.

---

### 4) Hybrid and private connectivity (on-prem ‚Üî AWS)

**Pattern:** Use **internal NLB** for private, high-performance endpoints; use **PrivateLink** (NLB-based) or Transit Gateway for cross-account exposure. NLB supports IP targets and works well over Direct Connect or VPN.

**Exam clue:** ‚ÄúOn-prem systems need to access a private endpoint hosted on AWS‚Äù ‚Üí internal NLB or PrivateLink.

Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs the updated version of that section with the correct order and referencing the AWS doc for layering an ALB behind an NLB:

### 5) When You Need Both Layer 7 and Layer 4 Behavior

**Pattern:** Use a **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** up front for static IPs, low-latency or multi-protocol ingress, with an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** behind it to handle Layer 7 routing (host/path-based) and advanced HTTP features.

**Why:** This layered approach gives you the best of both worlds ‚Äî the NLB offers high performance, static IPs (or PrivateLink support), and TCP/UDP flexibility while the ALB delivers smart HTTP(S) routing, WAF, and application-level logic.

**Exam clue:**
- ‚ÄúNeed host-based routing for HTTP traffic *and* static IPs or multiple protocols on the same endpoint.‚Äù

In that case, think **NLB ‚Üí ALB** rather than ALB in front alone.

Keep in mind that in this pattern, the ALB is often only one of several targets for the NLB ‚Äî just for those handling HTTP traffic.

## ‚úÖ Short decision matrix (use in the exam)

| Requirement                              |                                       Best pick | Why                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Host/path routing, WAF, OIDC             |                           ALB. | Layer-7 features and TLS termination.                        |
| Millions of TCP connections, low latency |                           NLB. | Layer-4 performance, preserves source IP.                    |
| Inline security inspection across VPCs   |             GWLB + appliances. | Transparent GENEVE forwarding to appliance fleet.            |
| Private on-prem access, static IPs       | NLB (internal) or PrivateLink. | Works over DX/VPN, supports IP targets.                      |
| Global performance + static entry        |                Global Accelerator + regional NLB or ALB | Use GA when you need static anycast IPs and global failover. |

## üß† Exam tips and traps

* **Don‚Äôt use ALB for raw TCP/UDP** ‚Äî it‚Äôs L7 only. If the workload is non-HTTP (gRPC over TLS can work on ALB if HTTP/2 is used) ALB is not the answer.
* **NLB and ALB both preserve source IP** ‚Äî handy for firewall rules, logging, or client IP-based logic, but the targets must understand _how_ the IP is preserved as they each handle it differently (Proxy Protocol for NLB, X-Forwarded-For header for ALB)
* **GWLB is the right fit for inspection**, not for app routing ‚Äî don‚Äôt pick it just because you want a ‚Äúshared‚Äù entry point. For shared ingress, the common exam pattern is a central *security* VPC with GWLB.
* **Consider operational needs**: TLS certificate management (ACM), autoscaling target health behavior, cross-zone balancing costs, logging requirements.

## üîß Real quick examples (exam-style)

1. **Scenario:** Global web app that needs path-based routing, WAF, and TLS managed centrally.
   **Answer:** ALB (internet-facing) + ACM + AWS WAF.

2. **Scenario:** IoT gateway receiving millions of TCP connections with source IPs required for filtering.
   **Answer:** NLB with Elastic IPs and security group/ACL rules.

3. **Scenario:** Enterprise wants all VPC ingress traffic inspected by a third-party firewall farm.
   **Answer:** GWLB + firewall appliances deployed in a security VPC, route traffic via GWLBE endpoints.

## üêøÔ∏è Bit‚Äôs final nut ‚Äî quick checklist for the exam

Before you answer:

1. What **protocol** does the app use? (HTTP ‚Üí ALB; TCP/UDP ‚Üí NLB)
2. Do you need **L7 features** (WAF, host/path routing, header auth)? ‚Üí ALB.
3. Need **static IPs**? ‚Üí NLB.
4. Need to preserve client IP for an HTTP app? ‚Üí ALB (X-Forwarded-For header)
4. Need to preserve client IP for an non-HTTP app? ‚Üí NLB (Proxy Protocol)
5. Need **transparent inspection** for security appliances? ‚Üí GWLB.
6. Does the scenario ask for **private connectivity** (DX/VPN/PrivateLink)? Think **internal** NLB/PrivateLink.

Answer with the LB that matches the principal requirement, and explain **why** in one sentence (that‚Äôs the exam style).
