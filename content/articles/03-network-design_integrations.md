üëâ *How CDN and global routing services (CloudFront, Global Accelerator, Route 53) integrate with other AWS networking and application-layer services like ELB and API Gateway.*

<!--more-->

Let‚Äôs go through exactly what you need to know for the exam ‚Äî focusing on **integration patterns**, **architectural reasoning**, and **service behavior**.

---

## üß≠ Overview

The exam expects you to understand how to **combine** global-scope services (CloudFront, Global Accelerator, Route 53) with **regional** services (ALB/NLB, API Gateway, etc.) to build globally distributed, resilient architectures.

You‚Äôll be asked to:

* Choose the correct front-door (CloudFront vs Global Accelerator vs Route 53)
* Describe how traffic flows between layers
* Understand how each integration affects **latency, failover, caching, security, and protocol support**

---

## üåê 1. CloudFront Integration Patterns

### a. **CloudFront + Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

**Typical use:** Global distribution of web apps or APIs hosted behind ALB(s).

**How it integrates:**

* CloudFront edge locations terminate HTTPS and forward requests to ALB as the origin.
* ALB can distribute traffic across multiple Availability Zones.
* You can configure **Origin Groups** for failover between ALBs in different Regions.

**Exam points:**

* CloudFront accelerates both **static and dynamic content** (keeps TCP connections open, uses AWS backbone).
* **Header forwarding**: Minimize forwarded headers/cookies/query strings for better cache hit ratios.
* **Origin Access Control (OAC)** or **signed URLs/cookies** secure origin access.
* CloudFront supports **custom error pages**, useful when the origin is unreachable.
* To ensure only CloudFront reaches the ALB ‚Üí restrict ALB‚Äôs **security group** to CloudFront IP ranges.
* ALB remains regional ‚Äî CloudFront gives it a **global reach**.

**Use cases likely to appear on the exam:**

* Multi-Region web apps using CloudFront for caching + ALB for compute layer.
* Reducing latency for static/dynamic web assets worldwide.
* Mitigating DDoS via AWS Shield and AWS WAF at the CloudFront edge.

---

### b. **CloudFront + API Gateway**

**Typical use:** Distribute REST or WebSocket APIs globally with caching and DDoS protection.

**Integration details:**

* CloudFront sits in front of the regional API Gateway endpoint.
* CloudFront can cache responses from API Gateway (especially useful for GET endpoints).
* For edge-optimized APIs, AWS automatically provisions a **CloudFront distribution**.

**Exam points:**

* **Edge-optimized APIs** (in API Gateway) are for global clients ‚Äî they already use CloudFront.
* **Regional APIs** are for clients in one geography ‚Äî you can manually front them with your own CloudFront distribution.
* **Private APIs** are accessible only through **VPC Endpoints** (no CloudFront).

**Benefits:**

* Global acceleration via edge network.
* API caching at CloudFront layer.
* Extra security: integrate AWS WAF, ACM certificates at edge.

---

### c. **CloudFront + S3**

This is the classic CDN pattern for static websites.

**Exam angle:** Understand that S3 is a **regional service**, so CloudFront provides **global edge distribution** and **origin access control** for security.

---

## üöÄ 2. AWS Global Accelerator Integration Patterns

### a. **Global Accelerator + ALB / NLB**

**Use:** Multi-Region active-active or active-passive applications that need:

* Static IP addresses
* Low latency routing
* Fast failover

**Integration details:**

* ALB/NLB are **endpoints** registered in Global Accelerator.
* GA health checks each endpoint ‚Üí routes users to nearest healthy Region.
* **Traffic dials** and **weights** control how much traffic goes to each Region.

**Exam points:**

* Works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), not HTTP.
* Improves performance for non-HTTP protocols (gaming, streaming, VoIP).
* Can front HTTP(S) apps too (ALB or EC2 web servers).
* Keeps client IPs preserved for backend inspection.

**Typical pattern tested:**

> Global Accelerator ‚Üí ALB (in multiple Regions) ‚Üí EC2 targets

or

> Global Accelerator ‚Üí NLB ‚Üí Private EC2s or EKS services

---

### b. **Global Accelerator + API Gateway**

**Use:** Global acceleration for REST or WebSocket APIs without DNS-based routing.

**Integration details:**

* GA endpoints can point to **regional API Gateway endpoints**.
* Provides static IPs and uses AWS backbone.
* Improves latency and failover compared to DNS (Route 53) alone.

**Exam points:**

* Particularly useful for clients with limited DNS capability (e.g., IoT).
* Still subject to API Gateway‚Äôs throttling and region-specific settings.
* GA does *not* cache ‚Äî it only accelerates transport.

---

### c. **Global Accelerator + CloudFront**

**Use:** Combine transport acceleration + CDN caching.

**Integration details:**

* GA provides static IPs ‚Üí CloudFront provides edge caching.
* GA can improve the initial TCP handshake and DNS resolution time (since IPs are static).

**Exam points:**

* Sometimes used when enterprise firewalls require whitelisted IPs but content still needs CDN distribution.
* GA can also improve performance for HTTPS negotiation before CloudFront handles HTTP caching.

---

## üåç 3. Route 53 Integration Patterns

### a. **Route 53 + CloudFront**

* Route 53 alias records can point to a CloudFront distribution.
* Used for custom domain mapping (e.g., `www.example.com` ‚Üí CloudFront distribution).
* Route 53 adds DNS-based routing and failover for CloudFront endpoints.

### b. **Route 53 + Global Accelerator**

* Usually not necessary ‚Äî GA already provides anycast IPs.
* But you can use Route 53 alias record ‚Üí GA DNS name if you want consistent domain branding.

### c. **Route 53 + ALB / API Gateway**

* Common for DNS-based global routing (latency, geolocation, or weighted policies).
* Use health checks for failover between Regions or endpoints.

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CloudFront**         | AWS WAF, AWS Shield (DDoS), ACM (TLS), OAC (origin access)                               |
| **Global Accelerator** | AWS Shield Advanced protection by default, TLS termination optional, preserves client IP |
| **ALB / API Gateway**  | AWS WAF, IAM auth, Cognito integration, TLS at regional layer                            |
| **Route 53**           | DNSSEC, health checks, failover configuration                                            |

You may get scenario questions like:

> ‚ÄúA company wants global API access with DDoS protection and caching, using API Gateway. Which combination of services provides that?‚Äù

‚úÖ Correct answer: *CloudFront in front of API Gateway* (edge-optimized API).

## üß† Exam Tips

* **Know which integrations happen automatically**:

  * API Gateway *edge-optimized* = built-in CloudFront.
  * Regional APIs = need manual CloudFront setup.
* **Remember Layer differences:**

  * CloudFront ‚Üí Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
  * Global Accelerator ‚Üí Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
  * Route 53 ‚Üí DNS (pre-connection)
* **Understand caching vs acceleration:**

  * CloudFront caches HTTP responses.
  * GA accelerates TCP/UDP connections (no caching).
* **Failover timing:**

  * Route 53: DNS TTL dependent
  * CloudFront: per-edge origin failover
  * Global Accelerator: centralized, sub-minute failover
* **Security layering:**

  * Edge (CloudFront, GA) handles DDoS/WAF.
  * Origin (ALB, API GW) enforces app-level auth.
