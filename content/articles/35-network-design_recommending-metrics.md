Hey there, network watchers! Bit here, perched high in the branches of your cloud infrastructure. Today we‚Äôre going to dig into the **‚Äúwhat to monitor‚Äù** part‚Äîmeaning which metrics you should pick so you can keep your network healthy, performant and ready for global/hybrid scale. If you‚Äôre prepping for the AWS Advanced Networking exam, this is one of the nuts you‚Äôve got to crack.

## üß≠ 1. Why Metric Selection Matters

Turning on logs or metrics willy-nilly doesn‚Äôt help much. What your architecture design needs is a **set of meaningful metrics** that answer questions like:

* Is this link healthy or degrading?
* Are we hitting capacity limits or bottlenecks?
* When did latency or packet losses spike‚Äîand where?
* Are the hybrid (on-prem ‚Üî AWS) paths performing within baseline?
* Are configuration changes or route-table updates impacting network health?

Selecting metrics is about **visibility**: giving your network team, your global architecture, and the exam grader proof that you *know* what to watch‚Äîand *why*.

## üìà 2. Core Network Metrics You Should Recommend

### a) Traffic & Throughput Metrics

* **BytesIn / BytesOut** (for AWS Transit Gateway attachments) ‚Äî see volume of traffic flowing.
* **PacketsIn / PacketsOut** ‚Äî count of packets. Helps when packet size changes but volume stays relatively constant.
* **BytesDropped or PacketsDropped** ‚Äî especially for ‚Äúno route‚Äù or ‚Äúblack-hole‚Äù drops in TGW.

**Why monitor:** High throughput might be fine‚Äîbut if drops or blackholes are increasing, you‚Äôve got a hidden issue.

---

### b) Latency & Loss Metrics

* **Round Trip Time (RTT)** and **Packet Loss Percentages** ‚Äî for hybrid links or VPC-to-on-prem, using **Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor** or similar.
* **Client Response Time**, **Target Processing Time**, **Request Processing Time** ‚Äî for load balancers (from access logs and CloudWatch).
* **Network Performance Metrics on EC2 (ENA driver)** ‚Äî e.g., when PPS (packages per second) limits are exceeded.

**Why monitor:** Latency and loss directly impact user experience. On the exam, a scenario might ask about degraded performance even though ‚Äútraffic volume looks normal.‚Äù

---

### c) Health & Availability Metrics

* **Status and State Metrics** for attachments/tunnels/gateways (VPN tunnel UP/DOWN, TGW attachment status) via CloudWatch and TGW Network Manager.
* **Utilization Metrics** for interfaces or attachments nearing quota or capacity (TGW per-AZ quotas).
* **Baseline Deviation Alerts** ‚Äì monitor deviation from historical baseline, not just absolute thresholds.
* **Route 53 Resolver Metrics** ‚Äî for hybrid networks using Route 53 Resolver Endpoints, track `DNSQueries` and `HealthCheckStatus` to detect DNS failures or endpoint unavailability.

**Why monitor:** It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúis the link up?‚Äù but ‚Äúis the link healthy and performing as expected?‚Äù

---

### d) Hybrid Connectivity & Multi-Region Metrics

* Per-AZ metrics (for TGW) ‚Äì differentiate traffic across Availability Zones.
* **Inter-Region Transit Metrics** ‚Äì bytes transferred between regions and attachments in multiple accounts.
* **Direct Connect Link Metrics** ‚Äì traffic, error rates, link flaps, and connection health over time.

**Why monitor:** Global architectures must handle failover, cross-region performance, and multi-account visibility. The exam will test your awareness of those dimensions.

## üß© 3. How to Recommend These in a Design Scenario

When you are asked to *design monitoring* for a network (especially hybrid/multi-region), follow this flow:

1. **Define SLAs / KPIs:** e.g., ‚ÄúGlobal latency < 150 ms‚Äù, ‚ÄúPacket loss < 0.1%‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo black-hole drops.‚Äù
2. **Map each KPI ‚Üí metric(s):**

   * Latency ‚Üí RTT / client_response_time
   * Availability ‚Üí Tunnel status / attachment status
   * Throughput ‚Üí BytesIn + BytesOut
   * Drops ‚Üí PacketsDropped or BytesDropped
3. **Select & configure sources:** CloudWatch Metrics, Network Monitor, TGW Metrics, EC2 ENA metrics.
4. **Define alarm thresholds & dashboards:** e.g., average client_response_time > 200 ms for 5 minutes triggers an alarm.
5. **Ensure global/central visibility:** across accounts and regions‚Äîuse **CloudWatch Metric Streams** to send metrics to S3 or Kinesis Firehose, or deploy the **CloudWatch Agent** on hybrid hosts for custom metrics.
6. **Document baseline and trend strategy:** measure initial baseline, monitor deviation over time.

## ‚úÖ 4. Best Practices & Exam-Traps

**Best Practices:**

* Pick **meaningful metrics**, not *all* metrics. Focus on high-value ones (throughput, latency, drops, health).
* Maintain a **baseline** and monitor **deviations** rather than static thresholds.
* Use **per-AZ / per-region breakdowns** for global performance visibility.
* **Centralize metrics** using **CloudWatch Metric Streams**, **cross-account dashboards**, or **Kinesis Firehose** for hybrid/multi-region architectures.

**Exam Traps:**

* Choosing irrelevant metrics (e.g., `CPUUtilization` for a network-only SLA question).
* Ignoring packet drops or black-hole metrics (`BytesDropped` due to no route).
* Failing to monitor hybrid links or cross-region traffic when the architecture clearly includes them.
* Forgetting latency/loss metrics for user experience‚Äîthroughput alone isn‚Äôt enough.

### üêøÔ∏è Bit‚Äôs Final Nut

Metrics are like the heartbeat and vitals of your network. If you pick the *right ones*, you‚Äôll **see problems before users do**, **understand what‚Äôs happening**, and **answer the exam scenario with confidence**. Keep your metrics sharp, your dashboards ready, and your network healthy. Stay metric-wise and stay clever! üå∞
